# **Secure Authentication System**

## **Project Overview**

In today's increasingly digital world, traditional password-based authentication systems are no longer sufficient to protect against sophisticated cyber threats. This project focuses on developing a **machine learning-based secure authentication system** that utilizes biometric data, behavioral biometrics, and multi-factor authentication techniques to provide stronger, more reliable security.

## **Problem Statement**

Traditional password-based systems suffer from several vulnerabilities, including weak password selection and reuse, which make them prone to cyber-attacks. Even biometric systems can be susceptible to spoofing attacks. This project addresses these limitations by integrating **AI-powered biometric and behavioral authentication methods**.

## **Features**
- **Face Recognition**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for face authentication.
- **Fingerprint Recognition**: Implements robust fingerprint authentication using feature extraction.
- **Iris Recognition**: Secure iris recognition with noise removal and segmentation.
- **Keystroke Dynamics**: Behavioral biometrics by analyzing typing patterns.
- **Gait Analysis**: Analyzes walking patterns for continuous authentication.
- **Mouse Dynamics**: Tracks mouse movement for behavioral-based authentication.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Combines various biometric and behavioral factors to enhance security.
- **Advanced Security**: Incorporates liveness detection, anti-spoofing techniques, and privacy-preserving methods like Federated Learning.

## **System Architecture**

The system architecture includes various components for handling both **biometric** and **behavioral** authentication:

1. **Data Collection**: Capture biometric data (face, fingerprint, iris) and behavioral data (keystroke dynamics, gait, mouse movements).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data for training and evaluation.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Implement CNNs for image-based biometric recognition.
   - Develop RNNs for behavioral biometrics.
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Fuse multiple factors (biometrics + behavioral data) for enhanced security.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), and Equal Error Rate (EER).
6. **Security**: Integrate advanced anti-spoofing and privacy-preserving methods.
